      <h1 class="u-font-heading">Cosmic Order Ceramics is a  California  handmade pottery brand </h1>
      <h2 class='u-font-subHeading'> 
        The pieces are made with reclaimed clay  ‚óè  All functional pieces are dishwasher and microwave safe

      </br>
      <p> I make each piece while on board in a houseboat, then I transport them by bicycle to a community studio to fire.</p>
      <p> The process is slow, meditative and enjoyable.  the inspiration to make artwork comes from seasonal changes & surrounding landscapes. </p>
      <p> Besides functional pottery I make small sculptures and vases.</p>

      <h3> On living in the Bay Area:</h3>
      <p>
          "One soft humid early spring morning driving a winding road across Mount Tamalpais, 
          the 2,500-foot mountain just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, a bend reveals a sudden vision of San Francisco in shades of blue, a city in a dream, 
          and I was filled with a tremendous yearning to live in that place of blue hills and blue buildings, though I do live there, 
          I had just left there after breakfast."
