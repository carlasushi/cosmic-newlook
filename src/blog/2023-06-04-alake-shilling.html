<p class="u-drop-cap-large">
    I discovered a remarkable artist last weekend during my visit to a gallery in LA with my close friend Robertinho from
    <em>
        <a href="https://www.leafbox.com/" class="u-link"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://www.leafbox.com/</a>. 
    </em>
<p class="u-drop-cap-large">
    Alake Shilling's exhibition, "A Bug's Life," showcases captivating ceramic sculptures that pay homage to childhood and the spirit of spring. 
    Shilling's imaginative creations, featuring snails, ladybugs, bumblebees, and other fantasy figures, evoke a range of emotions while reflecting on the duality of human existence. 
</p>
</p>

<blockquote>
    I have been ruminating on my fascination with A Bug’s Life since I was a child,” Shilling says. 
    “Snuggling on my comfy pillows and thinking about being a bug in my own right. Living in my cocoon and interacting with the human world at my own discretion. Very little has changed in my world, and A Bug’s Life is reflective of that.”

<p class="u-drop-cap-large">
    Her work draws inspiration from nature, emphasizing the need to reconnect with the natural world in an era of increasing disconnection. 
</p>

<p class="u-drop-cap-large">
    As an artist, Shilling finds connections between her pop culture imagery and the animal totems and mythology of Yoruba culture. 
    Her art is a celebration of nature's beauty and a call for societal rebirth.
