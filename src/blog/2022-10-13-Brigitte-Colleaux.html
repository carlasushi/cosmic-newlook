Brigitte Colleaux is a pottery artist based in London. She had a previous carrier in IT. She used to work full time for a bank. Brigitte felt like something was missing in her life, she needed a creative outlet. In the late 90's, she enrolled in a pottery class at a local arts center.

<p class="u-drop-cap-large">
    What fascinates me about her, is her courage to change carriers, from a finance world to a pottery studio setting. Clay is not fancy, it is a direct connection to the earth. Clay is, after all, mud. I try to imagine her transition from the corporate to the artist world. Was it easy? When did it feel right?

<blockquote>
    Glazes are the most exiting aspect of my work. I test for the sake of it, often with objective in mind! There are no borders - you become an explorer, and an adventurer.
</blockquote>

<p class="u-drop-cap-large">
    Maybe Brigitte was looking for an opportunity to play again, to feel free. Perhaps this material provided her with the opportunity to experience the world with the openness of a "child like mind". Do we all yearn for freedom through creativity? is art healing?
